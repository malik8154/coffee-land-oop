# ☕ Coffee Land OOP – C++ Coffee Shop Management System  

### 📌 Overview  
**Coffee Land OOP** is a **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** based Coffee Shop Management System that simulates an ordering and billing experience. The program allows users to choose between **Coffee, Brownies, and Sandwiches**, select flavors, specify quantities, and generate a final bill with balance return.  

This project demonstrates **core OOP concepts** including:  
- Classes & Objects  
- Constructors & Destructors  
- Inline Methods  
- Access Specifiers (Private/Public)  
- Arrays  
- Switch Statements  

---

### 👨‍💻 Features  
- ✅ Menu-driven ordering system  
- ✅ Coffee, Brownies, and Sandwiches with multiple flavors  
- ✅ Quantity-based price calculation  
- ✅ Billing with cash input and change return  
- ✅ Outro displaying contributors’ names  
- ✅ Demonstrates practical **C++ OOP concepts**

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Language**: C++  
- **Concepts Applied**: OOP (Encapsulation, Constructors, Destructors, Arrays, Switch Statements)
