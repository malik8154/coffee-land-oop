# Coffee-Land-OOP

A **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based Coffee Shop Management System** that simulates a café environment. The program is fully menu-driven and demonstrates core OOP concepts while offering a realistic billing and payment experience.

## Features

* Menu-driven system for:

  * Coffee (multiple flavors)
  * Brownies (multiple flavors)
  * Sandwiches (multiple flavors)
* Handles quantity for each order.
* Generates **total bill** dynamically.

  * If payment is **less than bill** → prompts user to either:

    * **Add more money** OR
    * **Reduce items**
  * If payment is sufficient → calculates and returns **balance**.
* Showcases **OOP principles**:

  * Classes & Objects
  * Constructors & Destructors
  * Inline Methods
  * Arrays
  * Access Specifiers
  * Switch Statements
